# Multidimensional_Knapsack_Problem_Modelling
This repo contains the following:

1- A Jupyter Notebook [MKP_populate_function.ipynb](https://github.com/AghaMS/Multidimensional-Knapsack-Problem-populateFunction/blob/main/MKP%20populate%20function.ipynb) containing a function that reads MKP data from .txt files and populates an instance (objective function coefficients, constraints' matrix and right hand side). A doc string in the function body shows details on input and returned tuple.

2- A Python file (MKP_populate_function.py .... the same as the Jupyter notebook, but in .py format)

3- A Python file (MKP_Math_Model.py) with the mathematical model of the MKP

4- Seven different MKP data files to be used as test instances
